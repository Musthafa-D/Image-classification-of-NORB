# Image-classification-of-NORB

Image Classification of NORB Dataset, PyTorch datasets, data loaders, and augmentations are used and implemented.
Training the classifiers using convolutional and linear networks.
Analysing and explaining the differences of the results.

Important things to be considered is that we converted the NORB dataset into .jpg formart,
then we separated the images with their respective class folders via file separator code and renamed the files accordingly,
then we used this train and test dataset as our dataloader and then implemented the rest of the operations.
