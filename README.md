# Image-classification-of-NORB
Image classification of NORB dataset using PyTorch in CNN and FNN.

Important things to be considered is that we converted the NORB dataset into .jpg formart,
then we separated the images with their respective class folders via file separator code and renamed the files accordingly,
then we used this train and test dataset as our dataloader and then implemented the rest of the operations.
